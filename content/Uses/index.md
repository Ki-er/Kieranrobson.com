A list of hardware and software I use! 

Inspired by [awesome-uses](https://uses.tech/)!

## Hardware 

**Desktop** - What used to be a prebuilt has slowly turned into a custom built Windows 10 machine running a Ryzen 5 3600 with 32GB DDR4 memory and a GTX 1060 6GB all on top of a Gigabyte Aurous B450 Elite motherboard. 

**Monitors** - The desktop connects to two monitors by BenQ. The primary monitor is a 28 inch 4k display and the secondary monitor is a 24 inch 1080p display

**Laptop 1** - My personal laptop is a Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 running an 12th gen i7-1260P with 16GB memory and a 51GB SSD, holding a Windows 11 Home OS.

**Laptop 2** - Placeholder for when I get my work laptop.

**Tablet** - iPad Air 5th Generation

**Phone** - Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G

**Watch** - Samsung Watch 5 Pro

**Earbuds** - JLab go air pop until I get myself a pair of Buds2 pros.

## Software

### Editor, Terminal and Extensions

**Editor** - I use Visual Studio Code as my editor whether it be for coding projects or just editing markdown or yaml files. 

**Terminal** - For my terminal I use.. Windows Terminal. I used to use the command prompt but then wanted something more polished that I could use with a theme. I mainly ue the terminal within vs-code though.

**Theme** - I use the [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) theme for its bright colours when editing both markdown and js files.

**Extensions** - I don't really use extensions as I prefer to use project specific tools within their projects, but the extensions I do use are [CSpell](https://cspell.org/), [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) and [GitLens](https://gitlens.amod.io/).
