A list of hardware and software I use! 

Inspired by [awesome-uses](https://uses.tech/)!

## Hardware 

**Desktop** - What used to be a prebuilt has slowly turned into a custom built Windows 10 machine running a Ryzen 5 3600 with 32GB DDR4 memory and a GTX 1060 6GB all on top of a Gigabyte Aurous B450 Elite motherboard. 

**Monitors** - The desktop connects to two monitors by BenQ. The primary monitor is a 28 inch 4k display and the secondary monitor is a 24 inch 1080p display

**Laptop 1** - My personal laptop is a Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 running an 12th gen i7-1260P with 16GB memory and a 51GB SSD, holding a Windows 11 Home OS.

**Laptop 2** - Placeholder for when I get my work laptop.

**Tablet** - iPad Air 5th Generation

**Phone** - Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G

**Watch** - Samsung Watch 5 Pro

**Earbuds** - JLab go air pop until I get myself a pair of Buds2 pros.

## Software

### Editor, Terminal and Extensions

**Editor** - I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my editor whether it be for coding projects or just editing markdown or yaml files. 

**Terminal** - For my terminal I use.. [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701). I used to use the command prompt but then wanted something more polished that I could use with a theme. I mainly ue the terminal within vs-code though.

**Theme** - I use the [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) theme for its bright colours when editing both markdown and js files.

**Extensions** - I don't really use extensions as I prefer to use project specific tools within their projects, but the extensions I do use are [CSpell](https://cspell.org/), [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) and [GitLens](https://gitlens.amod.io/).

### Web Technologies

**Backend** - As a lot of my projects uses [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), I use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) often for server side applications such as Discord bots and soon to be other bots..maybe. I use a mix of Hugo and Jekyll for SSG generation.

**Databases** - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as it was recommended in my Discord bot journey and it just works.

**Hosting Providers** - I use [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/) for my VPS provider, and run a Ubuntu 20.04 server which all of my projects are hosted on. Normally within [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

### Research and PhD tools. 

As a PhD student, my time is often spent in academic tools and software so I thought I would add them here too!

**Reference management** - I use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) for my reference management due to its web interface allowing me to access my sources anywhere. It also lets me take notes within Mendeley and the one click `Add to Library` feature is very useful!

**Note and Organisation** - I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to manage my life and PhD from taking notes, to storing office hours to even keeping track of when the Bin dates are. Without Notion, id be lost.

### General Software 
**Browser** - I use [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?form=MA13FJ) for my browsing needs, simply for the vertical tabs, they are so much nicer to use!

**Music** - For music streaming, I have been using [Spotify](https://spotify.com) for the past 6 years and have never looked back!

**Media** - For media streaming I use [Plex](https://plex.tv), having your own netflix like service with the content you own, is a game changer!

**Movie and TV Show Tracking** - As a stats nerd and a media buff, I use [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) and [Trakt](https://trakt.tv) to keep track of my movie and tv show habits.
